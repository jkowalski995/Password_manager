# Password_manager

This is simple password manager crated with PySimpleGUI which stores files in plain text.

I made this as my own one-day coding challenge.

## This repository consists of 2 files:
- `gui.py` which is the main app which create GUI and interacts with user
- `functions.py` which consists functions used in main program
